# Mastering Advanced Authentication and Authorization in Ruby on Rails

Ensuring the security of data and systems is paramount. One of the foundational pillars of cybersecurity is the implementation of robust authentication and authorization mechanisms. In this article, we are going to explore authentication and authorization techniques beyond the basic setups or implementations. 

## Authentication: Who Are You?
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system attempting to access resources. Think of it as proving your identity at the door before you're allowed entry. Is a crucial aspect of security to prevent unauthorized access.

There are several methods of authentication:

**Username and Password:** The most common method where a user provides a unique username and a secret password.

**Biometric Authentication:** This involves using physical or behavioral characteristics such as fingerprints, retina scans, voice recognition, or facial recognition to verify identity.

**Token-based Authentication:** Involves using a physical or virtual token (like a security key or mobile app) to generate one-time codes for authentication.

**Certificate-based Authentication:** Involves the use of digital certificates to verify the identity of a user or system.

**SSO:** Single Sign-On is an authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications or services with a single set of login credentials (such as username and password). The primary goal of SSO is to simplify the user experience and enhance security by reducing the number of times a user needs to log in.

**OAuth:** Open Authorization is an open standard authentication protocol that allows users to grant third-party applications limited access to their resources (e.g., data, profiles) without sharing their credentials directly. It is widely used for enabling secure authorization and authentication in the context of API access, mobile applications, and other web services.


**Multi-factor Authentication (MFA):** This method requires users to provide two or more different types of authentication factors, such as something they know (password), something they have (security token), or something they are (biometric data).
We will explain this method further because the majority of tech companies are adopting it to increase security in their authentication processes.

## Multi-factor Authentication
 
The objective of MFA is to add an extra layer of security beyond just a username and password, making it more challenging for unauthorized users to gain access.

Here are the key components and factors involved in Multi-Factor Authentication:

- **Something You Know:** This is typically a password or PIN.
- **Something You Have:** This involves a physical device or token, such as a smart card, security key, or mobile device.
- **Something You Are:** This refers to biometric factors, such as fingerprints, retina scans, voice recognition, or facial recognition.

## MFA Workflow

When a user attempts to log in, they first provide a primary factor, usually a username and password.
After successfully providing the initial factor, the system prompts the user to provide one or more additional factors.

### Common MFA Methods

Text Message (SMS): A one-time code is sent to the user's mobile phone via SMS.
Authentication Apps: Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTPs) generated by authenticator apps like Google Authenticator or Authy.
Email Verification: A one-time code or a verification link is sent to the user's email address.
Biometric Authentication: Fingerprint scans, facial recognition, or other biometric methods.
Hardware Tokens: Physical devices, like USB security keys, that generate or store authentication credentials.
Phone Calls: Automated voice calls providing a one-time code.

### MFA Policies

Organizations can define policies regarding when and where MFA is required. For example, MFA may be enforced for remote access, sensitive transactions, or specific user roles.
Risk-Based Authentication:

Some MFA systems use risk assessment to dynamically adjust the level of authentication required based on factors such as the user's location, device, or recent activity.

### MFA Standards

Various standards and protocols, such as OAuth 2.0, can be used to implement MFA. Additionally, organizations may follow industry standards like FIDO (Fast Identity Online) for secure and interoperable MFA solutions.

### Challenges

While MFA significantly enhances security, it's important to consider user experience and potential challenges, such as the risk of losing physical tokens or the need for additional user training.

## Ruby on Rails Implementation
The following steps provide a basic step-by-step example of a MFA implementation using Ruby on Rails. The steps can vary considerably depending on your project requirements and needs.

1) Install Necessary Gems

Use the devise gem for user authentication and rotp (Ruby One-Time Password) gem for generating Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTPs).

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'devise'
gem 'rotp'
```

Then run:

```bundle install```

2) Set Up Devise:
Follow the instructions in the Devise documentation to set up user authentication.

```
rails generate devise:install
rails generate devise User
rails db:migrate
```

3) Add MFA Fields to User Model:
Extend the User model to store additional information needed for MFA. You might add fields like mfa_enabled, mfa_secret, etc.

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  # Add necessary fields for MFA
  devise :two_factor_authenticatable, :otp_secret_encryption_key => ENV['OTP_SECRET_KEY']
end
```

4) Enable MFA in Devise:
Update your Devise configuration to enable two-factor authentication.

```ruby
# config/initializers/devise.rb
config.devise_modules << :two_factor_authenticatable
```

5) Update Views and Controllers:
Update your views and controllers to handle MFA during login, enrollment, and verification. You may need to create new views and controllers for MFA-specific actions.

6) Generate and Display QR Code for TOTP:
When a user enables MFA, you'll need to generate a QR code containing the TOTP secret. You can use the rotp gem to achieve this.

```ruby
# Example code to generate QR code
def generate_qr_code(user)
  totp = ROTP::TOTP.new(user.mfa_secret)
  issuer_name = 'YourApp'
  account_name = user.email


  uri = totp.provisioning_uri(account_name, issuer_name: issuer_name)
  qr = RQRCode::QRCode.new(uri)


  # You can use a library like rqrcode_png to convert QR code to PNG image
end
```

7) Verify TOTP during Login:
When a user logs in, you'll need to verify the provided TOTP against the one generated using the user's secret.

```ruby
# Example code to verify TOTP
def verify_totp(user, code)
  totp = ROTP::TOTP.new(user.mfa_secret)
  totp.verify_with_drift(code, 30) # Allowing a time drift of 30 seconds
end
```

8) Additional Considerations:
- Implement backup codes or alternative authentication methods in case the user loses access to their MFA device.
- Consider the use of recovery tokens for account recovery.
- Test thoroughly to ensure the security and usability of the MFA implementation.


Authentication is a fundamental aspect of cybersecurity and is crucial for protecting sensitive information and ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of data and systems. It is often employed in conjunction with other security measures, such as authorization and encryption, to create a comprehensive security strategy.


## Authorization: What Are You Allowed to Do?

Authorization comes into play after authentication and determines what actions a user is permitted to take within a system or application. It's like being granted access to different rooms in a building based on your identity and permissions. 
Authorization is about defining and enforcing permissions, specifying what actions or operations are permitted for a given user or system.

Authorization mechanisms often involve the use of access control policies, roles, and permissions. Access control policies define the rules and criteria for granting or denying access, while roles and permissions assign specific rights or privileges to users or entities based on their roles within an organization or system.

For example, in a file system, authorization might involve determining which users have read, write, or execute permissions for specific files or directories. In a web application, authorization could determine which users have access to certain pages or functionalities based on their roles (e.g., admin, user, guest).

Several authorization models and frameworks are used to implement access control; some of them are Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), and Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC).

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC is an authorization model where access rights are assigned based on roles that individuals or system entities have within an organization.

**How it works:** Users are assigned to specific roles, and roles are associated with certain permissions or access rights. This simplifies administration and management, making it easier to grant or revoke access based on roles rather than individual user accounts.

**Example:** In a web application, roles like "Admin," "Moderator," and "User" might have different levels of access to various features or functionalities.

## Ruby on Rails Implementation

Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can implement RBAC in a Ruby on Rails application using the Pundit gem:

**Install Pundit Gem**

Add the Pundit gem to your Gemfile and run bundle install:

```gem 'pundit'```

**Generate Policies**

Generate policies for your models using the Pundit generator:

```rails generate pundit:install```

This command will create a Policies folder in your app directory with an ApplicationPolicy file. You can also generate policies for specific models:

```rails generate pundit:policy User```

Replace User with the name of your model.

**Define Policies**

In your generated policy file (e.g., user_policy.rb), define authorization rules based on user roles. Here's an example:

```ruby
class UserPolicy < ApplicationPolicy
  def index?
    user.admin?   # Only admins can view the user index
  end


  def show?
    user.admin? || (user.id == record.id)   # Admins or the user themselves can view a user
  end


  def update?
    user.admin?   # Only admins can update user information
  end


  def destroy?
    user.admin?   # Only admins can delete users
  end
end
```

**Authorize Actions in Controllers**

In your controllers, use Pundit to authorize actions. For example:

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def index
    authorize User
    @users = User.all
  end

  def show
    @user = User.find(params[:id])
    authorize @user
  end

  # ...

end
```

**Set Up Roles**

Implement a role management system in your application. You can use a gem like cancancan or implement a simple role model with associations.

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :user_roles
  has_many :roles, through: :user_roles
end


class Role < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :user_roles
  has_many :users, through: :user_roles
end


class UserRole < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :role
end
```

**Check Roles in Policies**

Update your policies to consider roles when making authorization decisions:

```ruby
class UserPolicy < ApplicationPolicy
  def index?
    user.admin?
  end


  def show?
    user.admin? || (user.id == record.id) || user.roles.exists?(name: 'manager')
  end


  def update?
    user.admin? || user.roles.exists?(name: 'manager')
  end


  def destroy?
    user.admin?
  end
end
```

Adjust the conditions based on your specific roles and requirements.

**Role Assignment**

Implement a mechanism to assign roles to users. This could be done through an admin interface or as part of user registration.

```ruby
# Assigning a role to a user
user.roles << Role.find_by(name: 'manager')
```

Remember to thoroughly test your implementation to ensure that users can only perform actions they are authorized to do based on their roles. 

## Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

ABAC is an authorization model that considers the attributes of the user, the resource being accessed, and the environment to make access control decisions.

**How it works:** Policies are defined based on attributes such as user roles, time of access, location, and other contextual information. Access decisions are made by evaluating these attributes against the defined policies.

**Example:** Access to a file might be granted only if the user has the attribute "Manager" in their role and if the current time is during normal working hours.

## Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC)

ReBAC extends traditional access control models by considering relationships between entities, such as between users, resources, and the context of their interactions.

**How it works:** Access control decisions are influenced by the relationships between entities. For example, a user may have different access rights based on their relationship with another user or their position within an organizational hierarchy.

**Example:** A document may be accessible by a user if they have a specific relationship (e.g., supervisor-subordinate) with the document owner.

In web development, these authorization models are implemented through access control mechanisms in applications and web servers. The model's choice depends on the system's specific requirements and the complexity of access control policies. RBAC, ABAC, and ReBAC provide flexibility in designing access control strategies, allowing developers to tailor authorization mechanisms to the needs of their applications.
