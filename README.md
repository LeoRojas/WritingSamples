# Leonardo Rojas writing samples

## Hello!

My name is Leonardo Rojas. Iâ€™m a software engineer and technical writer; my writing experience includes blog posts, software documentation, API documentation, tutorials, how-tos, and step-by-step guides in the companies I have worked for in the past. Regarding my software engineer experience, I have over ten years of experience in software development and deploying web applications, mainly using Ruby on Rails, a framework I am passionate about and proficient in.

In addition to Ruby on Rails, I have a strong background in computer science (Bachelor's Degree), Python, PHP, and AWS, which I have leveraged to build scalable and secure solutions for the media production industry. I also enjoy mentoring and sharing my knowledge with other developers, mainly at Codementor.

In this repository, you can find articles that I wrote for blogs. More writing samples and other kinds of technical documents, such as database designs, cloud architectures, etc, can be requested via Linkedin or contact email. The writing samples available at this moment are the following:
